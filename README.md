Lightweight Rust IDE based on PyQt. (C++ feature is experimental)

Since rujaion is simplified and specialized to competitive programming, user can concentrate on programming and can achieve best performance.

Testing with sample cases, debugging with test cases, and submission can be by one click.

* Rust / C++ (If you opened *.cpp file, rujaion handles it as C++ source file. Otherwise, handles as Rust) 
* GUI debug
* Online judge testcases downloading and testing. (based on online-judge-tools)
* Debug with online judge testcases
* Do online judge submission
* Completer and jumper (based on racer) 
* Auto Formatting (based on rustfmt)
* Rust REPL (based on evcxr_repl)
* Live Templates (IntelliJ style)
* Contest Task Browsing
